Overview 
    Building a Website that lets people to build Mobile Apps using AI 
    bolt is the first company to do it 
    Users can see the demo on the Web or on Mobile as well in real time 
    Any Change made in the App , Ships eveything in Real time and can test it on both website and phone
    Can export it into .apk and can publish on Google Play Store


React Native architecture
    A bunch of tsx or jsx files, These are react native components 
    div is replaced by <View> , <Text> for writing texts instead of span or more 
    All gets Bundled into a bundle.js file using metro bundles [Similar to webpack or babel as in react ]
        budle.js is all that is needed to run a Mobile App , The state of Mobile app is defined by the bundle.js file 

    Serving React native file is simple as serving a bundle.js , Easier than bundling Swift/Java/Kotlin Applications 
    Written in Javascript , View transalates to Something else as in Androind app 
    React Native Application 
        A Native thread that is talking to JS code bundle.js , Tells native layer or dictattes how the app is workgin or rendering 
        .apk files also have a js code , bundler.js 

    In React native we only serve js file bundle.js , in website we serve html,css and js 

High Level Architecture
    Frontend ---(Create an App Prompt)--> Primary Backend ---> LLM [Talk to LLM with an exact prompt]
    LLM --> Backend[Where to store files? ], WHen user is on frontend, they can see the Code on the right
